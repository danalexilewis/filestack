# User Domain

This view contains the core user management functionality. Here you can find the user interface definition and test specifications.

## User Model

The User interface defines the structure for user data in our application:

```typescript:user/user.ts
// User Model
```

## User Tests

Test specifications for user functionality:

```typescript:user/user.test.ts
// User Tests
```

## Architecture Notes

The user domain handles authentication, profile management, and user preferences. All user-related operations should go through this domain.

This domain could be extended with:

- User API endpoints
- Authentication contracts
- User service layer
- User repository interface
