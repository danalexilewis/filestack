# Implementation Plan: FileStack Prototype

This document outlines the phased development plan for the FileStack Electron application.

---

### Phase 1: Project Initialization & Setup

- [x] **Initialize with `electron-forge`**: Use the `create-electron-app` command with the `vite-typescript` template to create a clean project structure.
- [x] **Add Core Dependencies**: Install `zod` for schema validation and `zustand` for state management.
- [x] **Confirm Dev Environment**: Run `npm start` to verify that the application launches and hot reloading is active.

---

### Phase 2: Workspace & Configuration

- [x] **Workspace Loading**:
    - [x] Implement an "Open Workspace" menu item.
    - [x] Add a button on the welcome screen to trigger the workspace dialog.
- [x] **Configuration Parsing (Zod)**:
    - [x] Define a Zod schema for the `filestack.json` file in `src/shared/types.ts`.
    - [x] Implement a function in the main process to find, read, and validate the configuration file.
    - [x] Communicate the parsed views or any errors to the renderer process.
- [x] **UI - Sidebar**:
    - [x] Create a sidebar UI component.
    - [x] Display the list of views from the configuration.

### Phase 3: Editor & State Management

- [ ] **State Management (Zustand)**:
    - [ ] Create a Zustand store to manage the active workspace path, the list of views, the active view, and file contents.
- [ ] **Editor Integration (Monaco)**:
    - [ ] Embed the Monaco Editor.
    - [ ] Integrate `monaco-vim` for Vim keybindings.
- [ ] **View Rendering**:
    - [ ] When a view is selected, fetch its file contents and update the Zustand store.
    - [ ] The Monaco Editor will react to store changes and display the content in a stacked format.
- [ ] **File Operations**:
    - [ ] Track file modifications (dirty state).
    - [ ] Implement a "save" function to write changes back to the filesystem.

### Phase 4: `Org-Mode` Features

- [ ] **Content Folding**:
    - [ ] Implement controls to collapse and expand each file section in the editor.
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**:
    - [ ] Create keybindings to navigate between file sections.
- [ ] **Task Highlighting**:
    - [ ] Add syntax-based highlighting for `TODO` and `DONE` keywords.
